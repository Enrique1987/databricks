They enable operations such as transforming array elements or filtering map entries, enhancing data processing capabilities within Databricks notebooks or clusters.  
`SQL UDF`:is a custom function created by users to extend the capabilities of Databricks' SQL language, allowing for custom processing and transformations of data. These functions can be written in languages like Python or Scala and are integrated into Spark SQL queries for use in data analysis and manipulation tasks within Databricks environments.
