**Question1  
A data engineer is working on a real-time data processing pipeline using Databricks. Before being loaded into a target database,
the pipeline must process and transform several data sources. The engineer has chosen to process and transform data using Python DataFrames. 
Which of the following DataFrame statements is the best course of action in this situation to implement a real-time workload autoloader ?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.Use the `df.writeStream` method to write the transformed data directly to the target database.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Use the `df.foreachBatch` method to write the transformed data in micro-batches to the target database.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.Use the `df.groupBy` method to group the data by key, then use the df.write method to write the transformed data to the target database.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.Use the `df.window` method to create sliding windows of data, then use the df.write method to write the transformed data to the target database.  

**Question2  
A data engineer is creating a data model for the sales data of a retail company. Information on sales transactions, goods, clients, and stores is included in the data.
The business wants to examine the data to learn more about consumer and sales trends. Which strategy from the list below would be ideal for creating the data model?** 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Use a star schema to model the data. The fact table would contain sales transaction data, and the dimension tables would contain information on products, customers, and stores.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Use a snowflake schema to model the data. The fact table would contain sales transaction data, and the dimension tables would be normalized to reduce redundancy. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Use a hybrid schema to model the data. The fact table would contain sales transaction data, and the dimension tables would be partially denormalized to reduce complexity. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Use an entity-relationship (ER) model to model the data. The model would include entities for sales transactions, products, customers, and stores, as well as relationships between these entities. hide Answer Explanation: 
 
 
Solution  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option A is incorrect. Star schemas work best when dimension tables are manageable and can be easily represented as a single table. If the dimension tables are overly complicated, 
it may be difficult to maintain data integrity and experience performance problems.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option B is incorrect. Snowflake schemas work best when dimension tables are highly normalized to remove redundancy. This strategy, however, might lead to complex queries and
decreased query performance, particularly for complex queries involving multiple tables.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option C is correct. A hybrid schema combines elements from the star and snowflake schemas. A hybrid schema reduces complexity by denormalizing some dimension tables while
reducing redundancy by normalizing others. This method allows for efficient querying while upholding data integrity, making it especially helpful for data models with large and intricate dimension tables.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option D is incorrect. Entity-relationship models may not be the best choice for physically modeling huge datasets; they work best for conceptual modeling. 
It can be challenging to convert effective physical data models from ER models, particularly for complex datasets


**Question 3
A senior data engineer is utilizing Databricks Structured Streaming to construct a real-time data pipeline that ingests data from various Kafka topics. 
By using a join with a static lookup table, the engineer hopes to enhance the data in the pipeline. 
Which of the following is the best method for performing the join in Structured Streaming?**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Load the lookup table as a static DataFrame, then use the DataFrame API to perform a join with the streaming DataFrame using the join method.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Convert the lookup table into a Kafka topic, then use the Spark-Kafka integration to perform a join between the streaming and lookup topics in Kafka.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Use the Databricks Delta Lake to store the lookup table, then use the Delta Lake integration with Structured Streaming to perform a join with the streaming DataFrame.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Use the Databricks MLflow to train a machine learning model on the lookup data, then use the MLflow integration with Structured Streaming to perform the join with the streaming DataFrame. 


**Question 4
Data Modeling When storing and processing large amounts of numerical data for a project using Databricks, a data engineering team wants to use external Delta tables.
They must carry out intricate aggregations of the data, such as averaging a particular column's value across various partitions.
In the external Delta table, which of the following options calculates the average value of the "quantity" column across all partitions?** 
 
 
A.
```python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/data")
average_quantity = df.selectExpr("avg(quantity)").collect()[0][0] 
````

B. 
```python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/data")
average_quantity = df.groupBy().avg("quantity").collect()[0][0] 
````

C. 
````python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/data")
average_quantity = df.agg({"quantity": "avg"}).collect()[0][0]
````

D. df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/data")
average_quantity = df.agg({"avg(quantity)": "avg"}).collect()[0][0] 


Solution:
B


**Question 5
Data Modeling A data senior engineer is working on a complex data processing project using Databricks and wants to leverage the AutoLoader feature to load JSON files
stored in cloud storage into Python DataFrames. The JSON files have nested fields and arrays that are organized hierarchically. Before continuing with the processing,
the engineer must perform specific transformations on the loaded data. Which syntax for a Python DataFrame should the engineer use to load the JSON files,
automatically infer the schema, and perform the necessary transformations?**


A. 
```python
df = spark.readStream.format("cloudfiles").option("format", "json").option("inferSchema", "true").load("dbfs:/mnt/data") 
df = df.select("field1", "field2", explode("field3").alias("nested_field")) 
```

B.
```python
df = spark.read.format("json").option("inferSchema", "true").load("dbfs:/mnt/data")
df = df.select("field1", "field2", explode("field3").alias("nested_field")) 
````

C. 
```python
df = spark.readStream.format("autoloader").option("format", "json").option("inferSchema", "true").load("dbfs:/mnt/data")
df = df.select("field1", "field2", explode("field3").alias("nested_field")) 
```

D.
```python
df = spark.read.format("cloudfiles").option("format", "json").option("inferSchema", "true").load("dbfs:/mnt/data")
df = df.select("field1", "field2", explode("field3").alias("nested_field")) 
```


Option A is correct. This option's code effectively makes use of the spark.readStream function, which is required to read streaming data.
The format is specified as "cloudfiles" by the .format("cloudfiles") directive, indicating that the files are kept in cloud storage. The files' format is set to JSON
by the .option("format", "json"). Automatic schema inference is made possible by the .option("inferSchema", "true") based on the information in the files. 
Finally, the .load("dbfs:/mnt/data") specifies where the JSON files are located in the cloud storage. The engineer uses the
.select function to perform specific transformations after loading the JSON files into the DataFrame df. In this instance,
the engineer chooses the fields "field1" and "field2" as well as the nested "field3" and gives it the alias "nested_field" using the explode function.
This makes it possible to process and analyze the transformed data further. 


Option B is incorrect. This option's code is not the best strategy because it employs spark.read rather than spark.readStream, which is inappropriate for handling streaming data.
Additionally, reading files from cloud storage using the "cloudfiles" format is not a valid option because of the spark.read function does not directly support it. 
 
Option C is incorrect. Because it makes use of spark.readStream's "autoloader" format, the code in this option is not the best strategy. The "autoloader" format does not satisfy the requirement for loading JSON files into Python DataFrames because it is not a legitimate format for loading JSON files.

Option D is incorrect. This option's code uses spark.read rather than sp   ark, which is not the best strategy.it is incompatible with streaming data because readStream is used. 
Additionally, the spark.read function does not directly support the "cloudfiles" format, making it inappropriate for reading files from cloud storage


**Question 6
Data Modeling A data engineer works on a real-time data processing pipeline using Databricks and Kafka as a messaging system.
The pipeline consists of several data sources that must be processed and transformed before being loaded into a target database.
The engineer has decided to use Medallion architecture for data modeling. Which of the following is the best approach for implementing the pipeline?**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Use Kafka's default partitioning mechanism to distribute the data evenly across a single topic.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Create separate Kafka topics for each data source and use Kafka's default partitioning mechanism to distribute the data evenly across all the topics.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Create a Bronze layer in Medallion architecture for ingesting raw data from Kafka, apply schema validation and filtering to the data, and write the validated data to a Silver layer.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Create a Gold layer in Medallion architecture for directly ingesting data from Kafka, apply data modeling and transformations to the data, and write the transformed data to a target database.   
 
 
*Answer*  
Option A is incorrect. It involves distributing data evenly across a single topic using Kafka's default partitioning mechanism. This can result in an uneven data distribution and make it challenging to scale and manage the pipeline. Additionally, it cannot filter the data according to a schema, which can cause problems with data quality.     
Option B is incorrect. It recommends setting up distinct Kafka topics for every data source and using Kafka's built-in default partitioning algorithm to distribute data across all topics evenly. While this method may be effective for small pipelines with a limited number of data sources, it may become more challenging to manage and scale as the number of data sources rises. Additionally, it cannot filter the data and perform schema validation on it.     
Option C is correct. In this process, raw data from Kafka is first ingested into a Bronze layer, after which the data is subjected to schema validation and filtering and finally written to a Silver layer after being validated. Receiving the raw data from Kafka topics, applying fundamental transformations, and cleaning it up are the responsibilities of the Bronze layer. After that, the data is filtered and validated following  the schema established for each data source. Before being loaded into the target database, the validated data is then written to a Silver layer where additional data transformations can be carried out.     
Option D is incorrect. It recommends developing a Gold layer to directly ingest data from Kafka, model and transform the data, and then write the transformed data to a target database. The Bronze layer, which handles fundamental data transformations, cleaning, and schema validation, is disregarded in this method. Avoiding the Bronze layer, data quality problems may arise that will impact downstream processing and analysis

Which of the following SQL statements should the data engineer use to build a dynamic row-oriented view that only allows users who are part of the "healthcare" group and the patients themselves to access the personal health information (PHI) of patients?** 

Options: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. CREATE VIEW patient_phi AS SELECT * FROM patients WHERE is_account_group_member('healthcare') AND current_user() = patient_id;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. CREATE VIEW patient_phi AS SELECT * FROM patients WHERE is_member('healthcare') AND current_user() = patient_id;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. CREATE VIEW patient_phi AS SELECT patient_id, patient_name, age, gender, is_account_group_member('healthcare') AS in_group, current_user() AS current_user FROM patients;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. CREATE VIEW patient_phi AS SELECT * FROM patients WHERE is_member('healthcare') AND current_user() IN (SELECT patient_id FROM patients);  


**Question 9: Security and Governance A healthcare organization is responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of sensitive patient data while adhering to data privacy laws. To achieve this, the company must create a data pipeline that manages sensitive patient data while ensuring that data can be safely deleted upon patients' requests, following laws requiring the company to abide by data deletion requests. The company wants to put best practices for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit into practice, in addition to adhering to data privacy laws. According to the organization, sensitive data must be encrypted when being stored, transmitted, and accessed by only authorized users.

**Question 22: Data Processing A data engineering team is working on a data processing project using Databricks, where they need to process data stored in a cloud object store. They recently implemented a Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanism to keep track of changes to the data source. By utilizing CDC and processing only the modified data effectively, the team hopes to improve the efficiency of its data processing pipeline. But, they ran into a complicated situation with numerous data sources and different kinds of changes. The situation is given below: The team works with two data sources: Source A and Source B. While Source B contains transaction data, which records the specifics of customer transactions, Source A contains customer data, including their profiles and contact information. Both sources frequently get new records and updates. The group wants to effectively and separately process the updated data from both sources. For Source A, updates to already-existing customer profiles and new customer registrations are the two categories into which the changes can be divided. The group must document both kinds of changes and apply particular modifications to the updated profiles, such as enriching them with new information from outside sources. Before continuing with the processing of new customer registrations, they want to apply many data quality checks. For Source B, there are three categories of changes: new transactions, updates to existing transactions, and deletions of transactions. All three types of changes must be captured, and the team must analyze the transaction data by aggregating transaction amounts and figuring out average transaction values. They also want to find any suspicious patterns or anomalies in the transaction data. Based on the given situation, what will be the best approach for processing the data using CDC?**** 

Options:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.Implement separate Change Data Capture mechanisms for Source A and Source

**Question 50: Data Modeling A data architect is faced with a challenging situation in a project using Databricks. The task at hand entails creating a data model for a sizable e-commerce site that sells a wide range of goods. The data architect employs a lookup table approach to enhance the data model and facilitate effective data retrieval. However, the architect runs into a singular and challenging situation that necessitates a calculated response because of the project's complexity. The e-commerce site keeps a sizable inventory of goods, including clothes, electronics, home appliances, and more. Every product category has a unique set of qualities and traits. The platform also provides several services, including customer reviews, ratings, and recommendations linked to particular products. The difficulty arises from the requirement to quickly query and retrieve product data and the attributes and services that go along with it. The data architect is aware that various products and services might make a traditional relational database schema produce a complex and ineffective data model. The data architect chooses to use a lookup table approach to address this problem. The goal is to develop a central lookup table that houses the characteristics and offerings for each class of products. The lookup table will act as a guide to help users quickly find the details they require for any given product. The lookup table must support a variety of product categories, each with its own set of characteristics and offerings. The lookup table's performance and scalability must also be considered by the data architect as the e-commerce platform develops and adds new product categories over time. In this situation, which of the following statements presents the most effective solution by addressing the data architect's requirements?**** 

Options:

The architect implements a dynamic schema design that adapts to the evolving product categories.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.The data architect opts for a hybrid approach by creating a combination of a centralized lookup table for common attributes and individual lookup tables for specific product categories. This approach strikes a balance between centralization and specialization, providing efficient querying for common attributes while allowing flexibility for category-specific attributes and services.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.The data architect decides to leverage the power of Databricks Delta Lake's schema evolution capabilities. Instead of using a traditional lookup table, the architect employs a nested data structure, where each product category is represented as a nested object with its attributes and services. This approach allows for a flexible and scalable data model, accommodating new product categories seamlessly.


**Question 51: Data Modeling A large e-commerce company's data engineering team is faced with a difficult situation when managing and updating a customer-facing table using Databricks in a production environment. Millions of users receive crucial information from the customer-facing table, such as product specifications, costs, and stock levels. A constant stream of new products, price adjustments, and inventory updates are added to the table. The team must modify the data and table's structure without impairing user experience or introducing inconsistencies. The need to maintain data integrity and make sure the changes are implemented precisely and effectively makes the situation even more difficult. The team must come up with a plan that reduces downtime, prevents data inconsistencies, and upholds high performance. The short deadline for putting the changes into effect makes the task more difficult. The team must develop a rollback strategy in case there are any problems during the process. Which of the following strategies should the data engineering team adopt in light of this situation to efficiently manage and modify the customer-facing table?**** 

Options:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.The data engineering team decides to take an offline approach to manage and change the customer-facing table. They plan to take a maintenance window during off-peak hours to halt all user operations temporarily. During this window, they will make the necessary changes to the table's structure and data. They will also apply any required data transformations and validations to ensure consistency. Once the changes are successfully applied, they will resume user operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.The data engineering team opts for an online approach using Databricks Delta Lake's ACID transactions and schema evolution capabilities. They plan to leverage the transactional capabilities of Delta Lake to perform atomic and consistent changes to the customer-facing table. They will use the schema evolution feature to modify the table's structure and apply the necessary data transformations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.The data engineering team decides to create a temporary table to hold the modified structure and data. They plan to perform all the necessary changes and transformations on the temporary table while keeping the original customer-facing table intact. Once the changes are successfully applied to the temporary table and validated, they will swap the temporary table with the original table using an atomic operation. This approach allows the team to minimize downtime by performing the changes offline and only swapping the tables at the last step.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.The data engineering team chooses to implement a gradual rollout strategy to manage and change the customer-facing table. They plan to introduce the changes incrementally to a subset of users while monitoring the impact and collecting feedback. This approach allows them to assess the changes' effectiveness, identify any issues, and make adjustments if needed. Once the changes have been thoroughly tested and validated, they will gradually roll them out to the entire user base.
