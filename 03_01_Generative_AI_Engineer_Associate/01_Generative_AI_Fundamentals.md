## Generative AI Basics

AI --> ML --> DL --> Generative AI:

Generative AI is a Sub-field of AI that focuses on generating new conent such as: 
	- Images
	- Text Audio
	- Code 
	- Synthetic data
	
**Why now ?**  Large Datasets, Computations Power, Innovative DL models (GANs, Transformes, RLHF)   
**Generative AI Use Cases** Image generator, Video Synthesis, 3D Generation, Audio Generation.

### LLMs and Generative AI

Generative AI:
- LLMs: Trained on massive dataset to achive advanced language processing capabilities. Based on Deep Learning NN
	- How LLM work: Encoding Transformer Model Decoding
	
	Propietary Models: Positive - Speed of development, Quality. Negative :- Cost, Data Privacy, Vendor lock-in
	Open Source Models: Task-tailoring, Inference Costs, Control. Netative:- Upfrom time investment, Data requirements, Skill Sets.
	
	**Fine-tuning** The process of further training a pre-trained model on a specific task or datast to adapt it for a particular application or domain.
