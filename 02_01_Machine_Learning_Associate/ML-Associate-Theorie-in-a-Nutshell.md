## AutoML
AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, is a process that automates the end-to-end tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems.
It simplifies the model selection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning steps, making machine learning more accessible and efficient, particularly for non-experts.

## Feature Store

A Feature Store is a centralized repository for storing, managing, and serving pre-processed features for machine learning models. 
It ensures consistency in feature calculations, reduces redundancy, and facilitates easier and more efficient access to features for training and inference across various ML models.
